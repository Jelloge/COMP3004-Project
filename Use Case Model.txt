Use Case Model:

Use Case: Setting up an interactive software simulation of the t:slim X2 insulin pump.
Primary Actor: The user (patient) of the insulin pump.
Scope: 
Level: User level (user wants to easily operate the t:slim X2 insulin pump)
Stakeholders and Interests:
The user (patient): wants an easy-to-use insulin pump system that delivers precise insulin dosages for effective diabetes management.
Tandem Diabetes Care: insulin pump manufacturer, aims to provide a reliable insulin delivery system.
Healthcare providers: want to ensure patients understand how to use the pump for effective diabetes management.
Regulatory bodies: wants to ensure the device complies with medical device laws and safety standards.

Precondition: 

Success Guarantee: The user interacts with the t:slim X2 insulin pump to monitor glucose levels and manage insulin delivery.

Main Success Scenario:
1.	The user starts the t:slim X2 insulin pump:
  a.	The insulin pump is removed from the USB charger.
  b.	The user hold the power button to turn the pump on.
  c.	The user enters the security PIN to unlock the device.
  d.	The user checks the insulin fill gauge at the top right-hand corner and ensures the 300-unit insulin cartridge is properly filled and inserted.
2.	The pump is configured based on the userâ€™s daily needs:
  a.	The user navigates to the personal profiles section, creates a new profile, and inputs their basal rates, carbohydrate ratios, correction factors, and target glucose level.
  b.	The profile is named according to their current routine/activity (ex: morning, exercise, sleep).
  c.	The user can modify or delete existing profiles as needed.
3.	The user administers a bolus:
  a.	The user accesses the bolus calculator via the home screen.
  b.	The user manually enters their blood glucose level and carbohydrate intake, or retrieves the values from CGM.
  c.	The device calculates the recommended dose based on insulin sensitivity and target glucose levels.
  d.	The user confirms or manually adjusts the suggested dose, and selects a normal, extended, or quick release bolus.
4.	The pump delivers basal insulin throughout the day:
  a.	The user selects their basal rate from their personal profile or manually configures it through the options menu.
  b.	The device continuously delivers insulin at the specified rate unless adjusted.
  c.	Insulin delivery is stopped when Control IQ technology detects low glucose levels (below 3.9 mmol/L), and the event is logged.
5.	The user reviews their treatment progress:
  a.	The user can view detailed records of insulin delivery events, such as the time and amount of the last bolus injection, changes in basal rates, insulin duration, correction factors, or alerts triggered by CGM readings.
  b.	Healthcare providers can optimize treatment plans if patterns or irregularities in glucose control are identified.
